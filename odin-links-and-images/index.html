    <p>This one opens on a new tab</p>
    <!-- href specifies the destination. If you don't feed a link, it gives it a _self value, so it will open on the same page. 
    The rel attribute describes the relationship between the current page and the link. 

    noopener prevents the open link gaining access from the page that its openned from.

    noreferrer prevents the link from knowing which page has a reference to it. You can use it by itself since it already has the noopener attribute
